    Hello! I'm Tomer Rudnitzky,
     a Computer Science and Statistics
      student at Tel Aviv University.
       I have hands-on experience in various programming
        languages and frameworks, honed 
        through academic projects and
         personal endeavors. My studies
          have allowed me to dive deep into topics like 
          data analysis, machine learning, and software d
          evelopment. I'm driven by a relentless curiosity
           and a passion for technology, data, 
           and problem-solving. Outside of tech, 
           I'm an avid scuba diver exploring the 
           depths of the ocean. I am actively seeking 
           opportunities to apply my skills in real-world 
           settings and contribute to innovative projects.
